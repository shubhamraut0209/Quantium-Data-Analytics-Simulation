# Quantium-Data-Analytics-Simulation
Quantium Data Analytics Virtual Internship – Forage (R-based). This repo includes my solutions to Quantium’s job simulation on Forage. As an Associate Analyst, I used R to clean data, segment customers, perform uplift testing, select control stores, and generate stakeholder-ready insights from retail transaction data.
